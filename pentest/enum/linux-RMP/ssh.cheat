# Fingerprinting
# 1. ssh-audit checks the client-side and server-side configuration and shows some general information and which encryption algorithms are still used by the client and server
./ssh-audit.py <TARGET_IP>

# 2. The detailed output of the connection setup with the OpenSSH server can also often provide important information, such as which authentication methods the server can use. Change Authentication Method
ssh -v <user>@<TARGET_IP>

# 3. For potential brute-force attacks, we can specify the authentication method with the SSH client option PreferredAuthentications.
ssh -v <user>@<TARGET_IP> -o PreferredAuthentications=password
